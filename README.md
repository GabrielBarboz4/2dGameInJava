<h1>Hi,</h1>

<h2>This is basically the finished version of what a "treasure hunt game" looks like when it whas made in Java.

If you found yourself curiously enough to run this project on your computer, feel free to get the VCS to download the code.

All this project was made following the instructions of RyiSnow on Youtube and needs to run on SDK +21</h2>
